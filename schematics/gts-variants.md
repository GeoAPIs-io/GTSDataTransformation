Two Variations of the Geologic Timescale: Chronostratigraphic and Geochronologic 
Both variants use a different set of hierarchical ranks, which are as follows:

Chronostratigraphic
*Eonotherm
*Eratherm
System
Series
Subseries
Stage
Substage

Geochronologic
Eon
Era
Period
Epoch
Subepoch
Age
Subage

Stage/Age
The lower and upper boundary stratotypes of a stage represent specific moments in geologic time, and the time interval between them is the duration of the stage (i.e, named age).
The stage includes all rocks deposited between two chronostratigraphic horizons defined by GSSPs. A stage is the lowest-ranking unit in the chronostratigraphic hierarchy that can be recognized on a global scale.

Substage/Subage
A substage is a subdivision of a stage whose equivalent geochronologic term is subage.
Since a substage is a subdivision of a stage it will be restricted primarily to a regional scale.
A more detailed definition will be provided after a discussion in the ISSC.

Subseries/Subepoch
A subseries is a chronostratigraphic unit ranking immediately above stages and below a series. It consists of one or several consecutive stages. The geochronologic equivalent of a subseries is a subepoch.

Series/Epoch
The series is a chronostratigraphic unit ranking above subseries or stages and below a system. A series consists of several consecutive subseries, or (when subseries are not used) of several consecutive stages. The geochronologic equivalent of a series is an epoch.

System/Period
A system is a unit of major rank in the conventional chronostratigraphic hierarchy, above a series and below an erathem. A system is composed of several consecutive series.
The geochronologic equivalent of a system is a period. As an exception, the rank of subsystem (Mississippian, Pennsylvanian) is used for the Carboniferous System.

Eonotherm/Eon
An eonothem is a chronostratigraphic unit greater than an erathem. The geochronologic equivalent is an eon. Three eonothems are generally recognized, from older to younger, the Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic eonothems. The combined first two are usually referred to as the Precambrian. The eons take the same name as their corresponding eonothems.

Eratherm/Era
An erathem is a chronostratigraphic unit greater than a system consisting of several systems.
The geochronologic equivalent of an erathem is an era. The names of erathems in the Phanerozoic were chosen to reflect major changes of the history of life on Earth: Paleozoic (old life), Mesozoic (intermediate life), and Cenozoic (recent life). Eras carry the same name as their corresponding erathems.


Nomenclature
A formal chronostratigraphic unit is given a binomial designation - a proper name plus a term word - and the initial letters of both are capitalized. Its geochronologic equivalent uses the same proper name combined with the equivalent geochronologic term:
Example: Cretaceous System - Cretaceous Period.
The proper name of a chronostratigraphic or geochronologic unit may be used alone where there is no danger of confusion, e.g. “the Aquitanian” in place of “the Aquitanian Stage”.
